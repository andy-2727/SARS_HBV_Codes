# SARS_HBV_Codes
Codes used in simulating SARS-HBV model with optimal control
The files "LHS_SARS_Hepatitis" and  "SARS_Hepatitis_State" were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis of the model paramters.
the file "Optimal_Control_SARS_Hepatitis" was used to carry out the optimal control simulations.
